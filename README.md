## Goal of Rabbit
Team FOX wanted to make the application that can recommend the safe route to the destination. Definition of safe route is ‘The route that has less probability to experience crime’. The Rabbit App is based on an safety route recommendation algorithm that considers the distance and crime occurence rate, as well as factor which shows high association with the crime occurence rate. The boundary of the Rabbit App is limited in Chicago. 

## Research Problem Statement
Public safety is one of the most significant concerns in the United States since crime rates in the United States are higher than other OECD countries. According to the [OECD Better Life Index](https://www.bbc.com/news/57581270), the homicide rate (the number of murders per 100,000 inhabitants) of United States is 6, which is 2.6 higher than the average of the OECD countries. Since major map applications, such as Google Map or Apple Map, recommend the route based on the distance from starting point to destination, we, the team Chasing FOX made the application that recommend the route based on distance and safety of the road.
